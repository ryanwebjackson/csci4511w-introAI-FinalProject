## Search for optimal fitness plan for pet animal

TODO:
1. ~~Determine algorithms used for solution search - adversarial search first~~
2. Determine how to interact with the user/consuming researcher/peer - candidate: Jupyter IPython notebooks
3. Run experiments (simulations and real-world)
4. Analyze results
5. Draw conclusions, and finish write-up

*Through iterative experimentation, several specific approaches will be tried, and the results will be compared. Below are the current ideas I have for these:*
- Mini-Max (with and without A-B pruning)
- Genetic algorithms (2 forms)
- Reinforcement learning
- Monte-Carlo Tree Search
- Random activity from both agents - serves as a control group
\end{itemize}

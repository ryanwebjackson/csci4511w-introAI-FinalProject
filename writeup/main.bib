@article{evangelista2019,
	abstract = {Grimace scales have been used for pain assessment in different species. This study aimed to develop and validate the Feline Grimace Scale (FGS) to detect naturally-occurring acute pain. Thirty-five client-owned and twenty control cats were video-recorded undisturbed in their cages in a prospective, case-control study. Painful cats received analgesic treatment and videos were repeated one hour later. Five action units (AU) were identified: ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whiskers change and head position. Four observers independently scored (0--2 for each AU) 110 images of control and painful cats. The FGS scores were higher in painful than in control cats; a very strong correlation with another validated instrument for pain assessment in cats was observed (rho = 0.86, p < 0.001) as well as good overall inter-rater reliability {$[$}ICC = 0.89 (95{\%} CI: 0.85--0.92){$]$}, excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.91), and excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89). The FGS detected response to analgesic treatment (scores after analgesia were lower than before) and a cut-off score was determined (total pain score > 0.39 out of 1.0). The FGS is a valid and reliable tool for acute pain assessment in cats.},

@article{talib2021,
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools play a significant role in the recent evolution of smart systems. AI solutions are pushing towards a significant shift in many fields such as healthcare, autonomous airplanes and vehicles, security, marketing customer profiling and other diverse areas. One of the main challenges hindering the AI potential is the demand for high-performance computation resources. Recently, hardware accelerators are developed in order to provide the needed computational power for the AI and ML tools. In the literature, hardware accelerators are built using FPGAs, GPUs and ASICs to accelerate computationally intensive tasks. These accelerators provide high-performance hardware while preserving the required accuracy. In this work, we present a systematic literature review that focuses on exploring the available hardware accelerators for the AI and ML tools. More than 169 different research papers published between the years 2009 and 2019 are studied and analysed.},
